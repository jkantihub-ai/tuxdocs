# 🐧 TuxDocs: The Hybrid Linux Documentation Portal

TuxDocs is a modern, responsive reimplementation of **The Linux Documentation Project (TLDP)**. It offers a core "Static" experience for local documentation browsing and an optional "Pro" tier powered by Google Gemini AI.

## ✨ Hybrid Experience

### 🏛️ Community Core (Static Mode)
- **Instant Search**: Optimized local keyword search across titles and summaries.
- **Vibrant UI**: A playful yet professional aesthetic with smooth animations and PWA support.
- **Review System**: Built-in community submission and flagging tools.
- **Virtual Terminal**: A local bash simulator for safe command exploration.

### 🧠 Tux Pro (AI Enhanced)
- **AI Librarian**: Natural language search that understands technical context and rankings.
- **Smart Insights**: Automated summaries and "Tux's Pro Tips" for every article.
- **Intelligent Shell**: Full AI-simulated terminal environment using Gemini Pro.
- **Contextual Chat**: Real-time assistance from Tux the AI Librarian.

## 🚀 Deployment
TuxDocs is optimized for **GitHub Pages**. All asset references use relative paths to support subdirectory hosting (e.g., `user.github.io/tuxdocs/`).

### PWA Installation
1. Open the site in Chrome (Desktop/Android) or Safari (iOS).
2. Click **Add to Home Screen**.
3. Launch TuxDocs directly from your device for a native feel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React 19** via ESM modules (No build step required for modern browsers).
- **Tailwind CSS** for adaptive layouts.
- **Google Gemini API** for the intelligent Pro layer.
