# 🐧 TuxDocs: The Modern Linux Documentation Project

TuxDocs is a modern, AI-powered reimplementation of The Linux Documentation Project (TLDP). Designed for the next generation of sysadmins and developers, it transforms static wisdom into an interactive, intelligent, and highly polished experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 AI-Powered Librarian**: Integrated with Google Gemini to provide natural language search, automated summaries, and contextual insights for every document.
- **💻 Virtual AI Terminal**: A simulated Ubuntu-style environment to test commands safely using Gemini Pro reasoning.
- **🛡️ Community Moderation**: A built-in proposal and review system for community-driven documentation updates.
- **📱 Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable on iOS, Android, and Desktop with offline support and a native-app feel.
- **🎨 Modern Aesthetics**: A clean, responsive design with vibrant orange accents, playful Tux branding, and smooth animations.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React (ES Modules)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Intelligence**: Google Gemini API (@google/genai)
- **Deployment**: PWA Optimized (Manifest + Service Worker compatible)

## 🚀 Getting Started

TuxDocs is built as a client-side module application. To run locally, serve the directory using any modern static server that supports ES6 modules.

### PWA Installation
1. Open the site in Chrome (Desktop/Android) or Safari (iOS).
2. Click **Add to Home Screen**.
3. Launch TuxDocs directly from your app drawer or home screen.

## 📝 About the Mission

TLDP has been the backbone of Linux knowledge for decades. TuxDocs aims to preserve that heritage while evolving the interface for modern workflows. We believe that learning the terminal should be as smooth as running a well-tuned kernel.
